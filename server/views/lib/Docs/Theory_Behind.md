# The Whys and Hows:

There are several potential benefits to a hybrid P2P/cloud system for user identification, such as:

1. Decentralized and distributed: By using a P2P network, the system can be decentralized and distributed, with data and processing power distributed across multiple devices. This can help to make the system more resilient and scalable, as it is not reliant on a single point of failure.
2. Increased privacy: A P2P system can offer increased privacy for users, as their data is not stored in a central location that could be vulnerable to breaches or unauthorized access.
3. Greater control: Users have greater control over their data in a P2P system, as they can choose which devices and networks to share their data with and can easily revoke access if desired.
4. Enhanced performance: A P2P system can potentially offer enhanced performance, as data can be transferred directly between devices without the need to go through a central server. This can help to reduce latency and improve the speed of the system.
5. Cost-effective: A P2P system can be more cost-effective than a traditional client-server system, as it does not require expensive servers and other infrastructure.

Of course, it is important to keep in mind that there are also challenges and trade-offs to consider when building a P2P system, such as the need for complex coordination and synchronization between the devices in the network. However, overall, a well-designed P2P system can offer many benefits and can be a powerful tool for user identification and other applications.
