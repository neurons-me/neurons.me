# QuickStart Neurons.me

Welcome to neurons.me, a collection of shared resources for machine learning, networking, and more! This guide will show you how to get started using the neurons.me npm package and its shared resources.

## Installation

To get started, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.

Then, in your terminal, run the following command to install the neurons.me npm package:

```bash
npm install neurons.me
```

This will install the latest version of neurons.me and all of its shared resources.

## Usage

Once you have installed the neurons.me package, you can use any of its shared resources in your Node.js projects.

Here's an example of how to use the `mlearning` module to train a machine learning model:

```javascript
javascriptCopy code
const { mlearning } = require('neurons.me');

// Define the input and output data
const inputs = [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]];
const outputs = [0, 1, 1, 0];

// Create the model and train it
const model = mlearning.createModel();
model.addLayer('dense', { units: 2, activation: 'sigmoid', inputShape: [2] });
model.addLayer('dense', { units: 1, activation: 'sigmoid' });
model.compile({ loss: 'meanSquaredError', optimizer: 'sgd' });
model.fit(inputs, outputs, { epochs: 1000 });

// Make a prediction
const prediction = model.predict([[0, 1]]);
console.log(prediction); // Output: [[0.97136754]]
```

In this example, we are using the `mlearning` module to create and train a simple neural network model. You can use any of the shared resources in a similar way.

## Conclusion

That's it! You now know how to install and use the neurons.me npm package and its shared resources. You can find more information about each shared resource in their respective README files.
