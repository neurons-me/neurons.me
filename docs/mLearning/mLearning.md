# mLearning

The `mlearning` module provides a convenient interface for running machine learning algorithms using OpenAI and OpenCV between others build from scratch.

mLearning is a module of the [neurons.me](https://www.npmjs.com/package/neurons.me) package that provides machine learning functionality for personal devices using openCV and openAI as dependencies.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to Neurons.me! If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. You can also open an issue if you find a bug or have a feature request.

## Installation

To use the mLearning module, you must have [neurons.me](https://www.npmjs.com/package/neurons.me) installed. You can install it via npm by running:

```bash
npm install neurons.me
```

After installing `neurons.me`, you can then use the mLearning module by importing it into your project:

```js
const { mLearning } = require('neurons.me');
```

## Usage

The mLearning module provides an easy-to-use interface for accessing machine learning functionality on personal devices. Under the hood, it uses openCV and openAI as its main dependencies.

Here's an example of how to use the mLearning module to classify an image:

```js
const { mLearning } = require('neurons.me');

// Load the model
const model = await mLearning.loadModel('path/to/model');
// Load the image
const image = await mLearning.loadImage('path/to/image');
// Preprocess the image
const preprocessedImage = await mLearning.preprocessImage(image);
// Classify the image
const classification = await mLearning.classifyImage(model, preprocessedImage);

console.log(classification);
```

In this example, we load a pre-trained model from disk, load an image, preprocess the image, and then classify the image using the loaded model. The `classifyImage` function returns a classification object with the predicted class and the confidence score.
