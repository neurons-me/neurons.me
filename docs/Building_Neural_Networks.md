### The Main Steps for Building a Neural Network are:
1. Define de model structure (such as number of input features).
2. Initialize the modelÂ´s parameters.
3. Loop: 
    * Calculate current loss (foward propagation).
    * Calculate current gradient (backward propagation).
    * Update parameters (gradient descent).
