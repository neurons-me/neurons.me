# **neurons.me**

This crate provides the **Rust core** for the **neurons.me** platform — a modular deep learning and neural computation ecosystem.  
It includes background services and computation engines responsible for training, inference, and distributed processing across the neurons.me network.

## Components
- **data_processor** – Handles and normalizes input datasets for neural computation.  
- **system_monitor** – Observes performance metrics and resource usage across the distributed system.  
- **computation_engine** – Executes neural computations, training loops, and inference tasks.

## Building and Running
Follow these steps:
1. Install Rust ([rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/))
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/neurons-me/neurons.me.git
